                            <p>I am a software developer from London, Ontario, currently living in Peterborough. I've been tinkering with computers and electornics since before I can remember. Currently I'm making the world an easier place to work in through semi-automation robotics. I hope to make a break into machine learning and distributed computing in the near future. </p>

                                <p>The CAN Bus Motor Controller Protocol was a project developed through 
                                    Lab Improvements for the purpose of designing a method of controlling 
                                    a variable number of setpper motors with as little IO usage as possible.
                                    By creating a system that sat overtop of the existing CAN bus communications,
                                    I was able to build a verbose method of specifying motor movement, which 
                                    allowed for variable length and speed movements with the option of 
                                    monitoring up to 2 inputs for change while doing so. The system also has 
                                    the capability of disabling motors between moves to reduce heat accumulation.</p>

                                    It's purpose is to recap and archive sample specimens that have been opened and tested by a medical lab.
                                    The Cap Track was designed to reduce repetitve strain injuries and potential exposure to pathogens, as 
                                    well as provide it's operators with more time to perform more important tasks than recapping tubes.

                                <p>My Singing Monsters is a game developed by Big Blue Bubble that has taken off in popularity since it's release. 
                                    I was invlolved in the concepts behind the breeding of the monsters, the quest system, and the game's economy.
                                    The game was eventually released to much success and has been turned into a bit of a franchise, with additional mobile titles, and even merchandise.
